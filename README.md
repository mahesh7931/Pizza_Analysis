ANSWER TO QUESTIONS
The busiest days are Thursday (3239 orders), Friday (3538 orders) and Saturday (3158 orders). Most sales are recorded on Friday
Most orders are placed between 12pm to 1pm, and 5pm to 7pm
Classic pizza has the highest percentage sales (26.91%), followed by Supreme (25.46%), Chicken (23.96%) and Veggie (23.68%) pizzas
Large size pizzas record the highest sales (45.89%) followed by medium (30.49%), then small (21.77%). XL and XXL only account for 1.72% and 0.12% respectively
Classic Pizza accounts for the highest sales (14,888 pizzas) followed by Supreme (11,987 pizzas), Veggie (11,649 pizzas) and Chicken (11,050 pizzas)
Top 5 Best Sellers are the Classic Deluxe (2453 pizzas), Barbecue Chicken (2432 pizzas), Hawaiian (2422), Peperoni (2418 pizzas) and Thai Chicken (2371 pizzas)
Bottom 5 Worst Sellers are Brie Carre (490 pizzas), Mediterranean (934 pizzas), Calabrese (937 pizzas), Spinach Supreme (950 pizzas) and Soppressata (961).
CONCLUSION:
The outlet should capitalize on Large size Classic, Supreme, Veggie and Chicken pizzas.

Since XL and XXL pizzas account for such a small percentage of their sales (just 1.94%), they can safely get rid of these pizza sizes.

Even though the Brie Carre pizza is the worst seller, it recorded 490 pizzas sold. It would still be a good idea to keep it in the menu.
